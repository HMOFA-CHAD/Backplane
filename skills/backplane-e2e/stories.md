# Backplane user stories (end to end)

What a person does with Backplane, as short stories to drive through the real
UI. Platforms: **W** web page (headless Chromium), **D** desktop app
(Electron, driven over CDP), **A** Android app (emulator), **I** iOS app (only
on a Mac; skip otherwise). Each step is a press, a key or a gesture; time it
(SKILL.md, "Timing"). The hub is `hub.sh`'s: projects `proj` (the fixture)
and `multi` (boards `alpha`, `beta`, plus an archived copy and a build
snapshot), stand-in agents only.

## Getting started

**S01 First run** (W D A)
Open the hub fresh. The guided tour shows; Skip closes it. Settings → Tour →
Show the tour opens it again; Done closes it and it stays closed after a
reload.

**S02 Add a project** (W D)
Sidebar `+` → enter a folder path (a copy of the fixture) → Add. The project
appears in the sidebar with a new thread selected; pressing Board draws its
board.

**S03 Find a project or conversation** (W D A)
Type part of a project name in the sidebar search: only matching projects
stay; clearing it brings all back. The search icon (Ctrl+Shift+F) finds a
word from an earlier reply; clicking a result opens that thread at that
message, highlighted.

## Talking to an agent

**S04 Send and watch the reply** (W D A)
In `proj`'s thread type a message and press Enter (A: the send button). The
message shows at the end at once, the composer empties, the turn shows as
working, the reply streams in and ends with a "Finished hh:mm · Ns" stamp.

**S05 Stop a turn** (W D A)
Send a message; while the reply streams press Stop. The turn ends as
stopped within 2 s, and the composer takes a new message that then runs.

**S06 Follow-ups while busy** (W D)
Send a message, and while it runs send a second (Send reads "Steer" while a
turn runs). The second is taken at once and answered after the first reply,
which keeps streaming in place (it does not jump). Ctrl+Enter queues it
instead: it waits above the composer, then runs by itself.

**S07 Long history** (W D A)
`hub.sh long` makes an 80-exchange thread. Open it: it opens at the newest
message. Scroll up to the first message ("Question 1") and back down to the
newest: every step moves, nothing jumps, no stall. Scroll halfway up and send
a message: the view goes to the newest page with that message on screen.

**S08 Reading while it streams** (W D)
Send a message; while the reply streams, scroll up a few notches (D: mouse
wheel with smooth scrolling). The view stays where you scrolled, the text
under the pointer does not move. Scroll back to the bottom: it follows the
stream again.

**S09 Thread lifecycle** (W D A)
On a thread: Rename (title updates everywhere), Pin (moves to the top), Settle
(moves under "Settled N"), Unsettle, Snooze 1 h, Fork (a new thread with the
history), Archive, Delete (asks first; the thread goes). Right-click (A: long
press) opens the same menu on a sidebar row.

**S10 Pick the model** (W D A)
Open the model picker under the composer, choose another agent, model and
effort. The chip shows the choice; the next turn runs with it (the stand-in's
log in `hub.log`/its args shows the model).

**S11 Attach a file** (W D)
Attach an image with the paperclip (or drop it on the composer) and send. The
message shows the image; clicking it opens the lightbox; Esc closes it.

**S12 Token stats** (W D)
Settings → Usage → turn Token stats on. The chip beside Send shows tokens,
cost (when known) and context; clicking it opens the panel with the last
turn's and the thread's totals.

## Seeing the design

**S13 Board** (W D A)
Open the Board view: the board draws within 5 s. Fit fits it; the wheel zooms
at the pointer; drag pans. Layers lists KiCad's layers; turning one off hides
it; clicking a layer's name dims the others (high contrast).

**S14 Schematic and its sheets** (W D A)
Open the Schematic: the root sheet draws. Click a sheet symbol: that sheet
opens and the trail shows where you are; Up/Back return to the root.

**S15 3D** (W D A)
Open 3D: the board's model draws; drag turns it, the wheel zooms, Fit
recentres.

**S16 Pick a board** (W D A)
In `multi`, open the board picker: it offers `alpha` and `beta` only (not the
archive copy or the build snapshot), the default first. Pick `beta`: Board,
Schematic and 3D all show `beta`.

**S17 Design history** (W D)
Have the agent change the board (send `mode:toolhold` with a stand-in that
edits, or edit the board file by hand while a turn runs). A step tick appears
on the history bar; Play steps through; Compare shows the change marked.

**S18 Files, Diff, Review** (W D A)
Files lists the project folder; opening a board file shows it in the Board
view. Diff shows the project's changes. Review → BOM lists the parts.

**S19 Viewer layout** (W D)
Drag the viewer's left edge: it resizes and keeps that width after a reload;
a double-click resets it. Close the viewer; open it again from the rail.

## Settings and workspace

**S20 Appearance** (W D A)
Settings → Appearance: switch the theme (applies at once), the text size
(text grows), the language to 日本語 where it is offered (labels change; on
the web it is a preview, opened with `?lang=ja`) and back, and the sidebar
to Active (one list of live threads).

**S21 Folding the sidebars** (W D)
Ctrl+B (Cmd+B) folds the sidebar to a strip and back; the rail's chevron makes
the rail icons only. Both stay after a reload.

**S22 Command palette and shortcuts** (W D)
With a thread open: Ctrl+K opens the palette; typing filters; Enter runs
"New thread". Ctrl+N makes a thread in the open thread's project (with none
open it goes to the uberbot's chat), Ctrl+J opens the floating terminal (it runs `echo hi`), Ctrl+1 jumps
to the first thread, Ctrl+Shift+S settles it.

**S23 API keys** (W D A)
Settings → API keys: add `E2E_KEY` with a value. Only the name is listed,
never the value; Remove deletes it.

**S24 Settings stick** (W D)
Change Threads → notifications and Time zone; reload: both kept.

## Bots and routines

**S25 A bot** (W D)
Bots `+` → make a bot; it appears with its cat. Open it and send a message:
it answers (stand-in). Rooms `+` → make a room, post in it; the post shows.

**S26 A routine** (W D)
Make a routine "in 1 minute: say hello" on a thread. It shows in Routines with
its time in your zone, and fires: the thread gets the message.

## Phone

**S27 Pair a phone** (A)
Open the hub's pairing link (`PAIR` from `hub.sh`) on the phone: it pairs and
lists the projects and threads ("Connected").

**S28 Wrong pairing** (A)
Pair with the link without its token: the banner says "Hub rejected
credentials; check the pairing link", below the status bar; pairing again
with the right link clears it.

**S29 Phone thread** (A)
Open a thread, send a message: it shows at once, the reply streams. Swipe up
through the history and back down; while a reply streams, a swipe up holds.

**S30 Phone viewer** (A)
Open the viewer from a thread: the board draws; pinch zooms; the Sheet menu
picks a schematic sheet and, in `multi`, a board.

## Coming back

**S31 Hub restart** (W D A)
With a draft typed (not sent), `hub.sh restart`: the page says Connecting…,
then comes back by itself within 10 s with the draft and the thread intact.

**S32 Reload keeps your place** (W D)
Open a thread, type a draft, open the Schematic. Reload: the same thread,
draft and viewer tab are back.
